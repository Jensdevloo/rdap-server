# RDAP SQL provider Download

This is our default implementation for the connection with our database implemented in MySQl, which we use as a Database server provider.


- **Bold** marks the most recommended version(s).  
- Normal font signals recommended fallback versions in case the previous option fails you [bug reports welcomed](https://github.com/NICMx/rdap-sql-provider/issues).  
- ~~Striked~~ versions are not recommended (either because theyâ€™re too old or have known critical bugs).
