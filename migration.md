# Exporting a database to Red Dog's built-in schema

## Introduction

Red Dog's builtin schema is an ordinary relational database conceived in MySQL. Users that aim to implement [Option 3](intro.html#option-3-using-red-dogs-builtin-schema) need to build a mechanism to populate this database and keep it updated.

The means through which the data is exported will depend on how the data is stored in the origin database, this documentation cannot fall into details on how to do it. Instead, this will serve as reference material for Red Dog's schema.

Red Dog's database contains 68 tables. Though the task of populating them might seem daunting, it is important to note that's likely to need only a fraction of them. The main ones are [autonomous_system_number](https://github.com/NICMx/rdap-sql-provider/blob/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/sql/Database.sql#L365), [domain](https://github.com/NICMx/rdap-sql-provider/blob/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/sql/Database.sql#L161), [entity](https://github.com/NICMx/rdap-sql-provider/blob/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/sql/Database.sql#L25), [ip_network](https://github.com/NICMx/rdap-sql-provider/blob/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/sql/Database.sql#L626) and [nameserver](https://github.com/NICMx/rdap-sql-provider/blob/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/sql/Database.sql#L423). Pick only the ones needed and branch from there.

## Full Schema definition

The script to generate the database is located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NICMx/rdap-sql-provider/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/sql/Database.sql "SQL file with tables") and the ER diagram [here](img/diagram/db-er.png).

The following table shows the database tables, to see more detail of each table there's a link to its creation script:
