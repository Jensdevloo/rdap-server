# Demo Server Download

A sample demonstration of a Red Dog server; a standalone Tomcat binary packaged with Red Dog and an embedded (H2-based) database populated with dummy data. The only requirement is Java 8 or superior.

Unzip it and run it with `java -jar demo.jar`. Documentation [here](demo-server.html)

- **Bold** marks the most recommended version(s).
- Normal font signals recommended fallback versions in case the previous option fails you [bug reports welcomed](https://github.com/NICMx/rdap-server/issues).
- ~~Striked~~ versions are not recommended (either because theyâ€™re too old or have known critical bugs).
