# Contact

- <reddog-public@nic.mx> is a mail list intended for general public discussion and news. Questions, requests and comments are welcomed.  
Registration to this list can be done [here](https://mail-lists.nic.mx/listas/listinfo/reddog-public).

- <reddog-news@nic.mx> is a mail list intended to inform news to its recipients. At this point, it is only used to signal new releases being published at this site.  
Anyone can listen, but only the dev team can place mails here, so donâ€™t worry about spam.  
Registration to this list can be done [here](https://mail-lists.nic.mx/listas/listinfo/reddog-news).  
Because of its purpose, this list rarely sees more than one e-mail a month.

- <reddog-dev@nic.mx> is a mail alias you can use to reach developers only.
Though the team is willing to provide advice via this medium, they would be grateful if instead the mail <reddog-public@nic.mx> is used for this purpose, so a future archive surfer can benefit from the experience.  

- The official bug tracker is the [Github corner](https://github.com/NICMx/rdap-server/issues). This is also a good place to request features.
